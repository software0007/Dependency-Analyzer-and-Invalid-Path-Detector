Dependency Analyzer and Invalid Path Detector
SemDDA is a Python-based tool that analyzes SQL dependencies in .jsp files and identifies invalid data flow paths. It features both syntax and semantic analysis using different abstract domains and includes a GUI built using Tkinter.

ðŸš€ Features
Parses .jsp files and identifies SQL statements.

Detects direct and indirect dependencies between attributes.
Performs Syntactic analysis
Performs semantic analysis using:

Interval Domain

Polyhedra Domain

Provides GUI-based interaction for easy use.

Highlights:

Valid and invalid paths

Execution time

ðŸ§  Under the Hood
Modules
Preprocessor: Adds line numbers, counts SQL statements, and ignores comments.

ExtractInfo: Gathers variable usage and control structures.

Dependency Analyzer: Computes syntax-based dependencies.

Abstraction: Performs semantic analysis using interval or polyhedra.

ðŸ–¥ GUI Overview
Built with Python Tkinter, the GUI guides users through every step of dependency detection.
